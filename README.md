# Web Chat Me

## Description Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

Messaging today seems easy. Technology is advancing rapidlyâ€“ we send quick texts to loved ones in seconds. However, even with the easy access, we still run into problems. iPhone users get annoyed with green texts, and Android users get annoyed with iPhone users. Computers can link to phones but it's not as simple and easy as people would like. Web Chat Me is here to build unity in the instant message space. You can message all of the important people in your life from one platform that's the same across all devices. Easily connect with others without any drama. No more bias, no more bickering, lots more benefits. Log in today!
